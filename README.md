# ble-multiple-services-and-chars

This project requires a nucleo-STM32f411RE nucleo board and a IDB05A1 bluetooth expansion board. I used the course Bluetooth Low Energy From the Ground up on udemy link here: https://www.udemy.com/course/bluetooth-low-energy-ble/ and did one of the coding projects. I also recommend getting a BLE app from the google play store. I used Light Blue but any BL app can be used.
